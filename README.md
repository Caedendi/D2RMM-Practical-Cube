# Practical Cube for D2RMM

Quality of Life mod that consolidates the cube from a screen-filling window to a small window directly next to the inventory for quick inventory management and transmuting.

Supports both the default inventory UI and [olegbl](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/353885)'s [Expanded Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/172) mod.
